Description: >
  DOSBox-X emulates a PC necessary for running many DOS games and applications that simply cannot
  be run on modern PCs and operating systems, similar to DOSBox.
  It retains compatibility with the wide base of DOS games and DOS gaming DOSBox was designed for.
  But it is also a platform for running DOS applications, including emulating the environments to
  run Windows 3.x, 9x and ME and software written for those versions of Windows and NEC PC-98
  emulations.
